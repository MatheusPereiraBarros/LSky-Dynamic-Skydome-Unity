# Things to keep in mind

- You need to assign a new layer to the moon.
- The gpu gems2 model is fixed in a perspective from the ground, does not currently support the aerial perspective, this may change in the future.
- No fog tinted with the color of the sky at the moment.
- There is no documentation for now.
- The code may be misaligned in some IDE, I do not know why it appears like this in github

# Future

- There will be no support for HDRP / LDRP / Job System / ECS.
- I will try to give some support to this asset in my free time, but I do not promise to bring great features.
